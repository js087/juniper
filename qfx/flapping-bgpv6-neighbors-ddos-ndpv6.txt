#2023 - July
- This predated me, but came to light during a migration (again) on different hardware and for a different reason specific to the `mx204` platform - except with BGPv4 neighbors only.
- This tied into a similar problem at this location in the past, except then it was a qfx5100, and instead of IPv4 BGP neighbors, it was only IPv6 BGP neighbors only.
-- This case after a colleague had worked with JTAC for months on this issue discovering some sort of influx of NDPv6 requests causing IPv6 unicast neighbors to become unreachable and thus with aggressive BGP timers we'd exceed the hold timers and the season would drop.

Purely for documentation sake - I don't know the specifics.
you@device> show configuration | display set | match ddos 
set system ddos-protection protocols arp aggregate bandwidth 5000
set system ddos-protection protocols arp aggregate burst 1000
set system ddos-protection protocols ndpv6 aggregate bandwidth 1200

#^ the above solved the issues for the bouncing BGPv6 neighbors at the time, and though we didn't see it at the time, it probably also stopped BGPv4 neighbors from bouncing as well with the `arp aggregate` parameters in place.

#Verification
you@device> show policer | grep arp 
__default_arp_policer__                                 0                    0  <-- Not useful, but given those are `ddos-protection` profiles above, different set of commands

#Operational commands to chase `ddos-protection` items
show ddos-protection statistics
show ddos-protection protocols
show ddos-protection version
